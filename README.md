# Coal Mine Evacuation System Using Multi-Sensor Control

## Overview
This project presents a coal mine evacuation system using Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi, equipped with sensors to monitor temperature, air quality, sound, and light. In emergencies, alarms and real-time information on an LCD guide miners to safety.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Grove Pi Sensors: 
  - LEDs
  - Sound
  - Temperature/Humidity
  - Light
  - Ultrasonic
  - Rotary Angle
  - Buzzer
  - RGB LCD
  - Air Quality
  - Relay
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires

## Functionality
- **Monitoring**: Sensors track environmental conditions.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Activates alarms (LEDs, buzzer) and sends notifications if hazards are detected.
- **Lighting Control**: Adjusts lighting based on ambient light.
- **Emergency Kit Locations**: Displays location on the LCD.

## Conclusion
This system enhances coal mine safety by detecting hazards and guiding miners with real-time alerts and information.
